# Note Taker

## AS A small business owner

- I WANT to be able to write and save notes
  SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## GIVEN a note-taking application

- WHEN I open the Note Taker
  THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

- WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
  THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

- WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
  THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

- WHEN I click on the Save icon
  THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

- WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
  THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
